# Inspiration
Just like my first web page. Since my hobby includes movie and animations, I took it as an inspiration to create a website and enjoyed it. Better design was made in Second Index HTML template project. I shared this repository to share my early journey as I enter the IT industry. I'm not ashamed to share this since this is my first step which gave me motivation and dream to be a web developer.

That time, my weakness is design but if there is an inspiration, reference, "a requirement" or "duplicate a website", since I am a technical person which follows a certain algorithm, I can build a page from a prototype or a model.

During the building of this second index, I improved my page including javascript, forms, and links. That time, the only thing I'm focused is to learn everything. It's more like: 
First I need to know the basics of every tutorial
Second, implement "each" topic so I can be familiar of it and apply it
Third, after learning to implement what I've learned, the next action is to improved my code writing, commenting, organizing repo and managed versions

Most recent and detailed repository of my Zuitt Bootcamp journey will be found on gitlab https://gitlab.com/chuacharlesbon
Zuitt really made me a better developer. But I wont stop from there. Im happy to learn more and continue this journey.
